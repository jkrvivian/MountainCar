# Mountain-car

Mountain car is a reinforcement learning environment in gym.
Here I've tried Q Learning and Deep Q Learning two different algorithms.

## Prerequiste
* Tensorflow
* gym

## Usage
### Run Q Learning
`$ python q_learn.py`

### Run DQN
Could choose to use a trained-well model
`$ python run.py [--reuse=True, False]`

As for DQN algorithm implementation, I reference this tutorial:
